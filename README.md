# React + Vite

- I've created a Todo list using ReactJS and Vite
- I've used Tailwind CSS to style my Todo List application
- I created a Registration.jsx where users can register and login where users can login once they have registered
- I created a TodoList.jsx where users can add, delete and edit their todo list
- I've created a TodoItem.jsx where users can add, delete and edit their todo item
- The TodoItems component is used to display individual tasks in a to-do list. It shows the task's text, a tick icon (indicating completion or an action), and a delete button (trash icon)it handles the visual representation of each to-do item and provides a way to delete tasks
- I've added a search bar
- I've added axios to make requests to the backend

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
